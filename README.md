# Monoply-Snakes-and-Ladders-Game


## Introduction
In this project we built a simple game application that is a mixture between the 
**Snakes & Ladders** and **Monopoly** games. There are two modes in the game: _Design mode_ is where 
the user is able to build the playing grid and _Play mode_ is where he plays the game itself. The general 
idea of the game is four players moving in a grid having snakes, ladders, and Cards. The player goal 
is to get to the last cell before anyone else. He also takes advantage of the special cells to boost his 
game and obstruct his opponents. The game ends when a player reaches the last cell.
